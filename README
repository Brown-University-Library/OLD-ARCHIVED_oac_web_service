Jython OAC Web Service


=== Enabling JMS ===

Enabled the JMS interface so that we can listen for updates to FEDORA datastreams.  Edit your fedora.fcfg file and change the <module> with class="fedora.server.messaging.MessagingModule" from 
<param name="enabled" value="false"/>
to 
<param name="enabled" value="true"/>


=== Changing the default content model ===

fedora_settings.py has a line for changing the default content model associated with annotations in Fedora. 
If you change this, you also need to edit the oac_web_service/resources/ezservice/ez_sdep_serialize.xml file
and change "bdr-cmodel:oa-annotation" to be the same value as in fedora_settings.py.
